Here's an HTML-formatted version of the above text.  Since the original text is primarily manga speech bubbles and lacks coherent sentences, a literal translation isn't feasible.  Instead, I've provided a descriptive interpretation in English. ```html   

Panel 1: A character expresses confusion and slight discomfort.

  

Panel 2:  A character seems slightly embarrassed or flustered.

  

Panel 3: A question is asked, possibly relating to something unexpected.

  

Panel 4:  A character seems to be experiencing a sudden rush of feelings.

  

Panel 5: A character is leaving; the narrative indicates that a good opportunity has presented itself.

  

Panel 6:  A character is leaving and cautions another to watch out for cars.

  

Panel 7: Confirmation is given and that character departs.
